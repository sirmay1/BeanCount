        <h3 class="explain-head">Welcome To The Coffee Count Tool...</h3>
        <p class="explain-p">To make entries for your caffeine intake please enter the following:
            Enter the date.
            Enter your user name.
            Enter a numeric value for the cup size.
            Please select the radio checker to indicate the .oz size option.
            Lastly, your total cups per day. Researching the exact quantity, coffee strength, quality, types, leads to many different
            possibly variations of a large range of how much caffeine can be found in a typical cup of coffee
            within a 6.oz cup. YES, the standard cup size is 6.oz due to the standard coffee machines which brew
            coffee in general. Afterwards you would have to contend with other sizes such as 6.oz, 8.oz, 10.oz, 12.oz, 16.oz
            21.oz, and yes even 29.oz exist! But doing further research I came to the conclusion that the two coffee types which
            have the most in common is Arabic and Hispanic coffee from the Carribean such as Cuba and Puerto Rico which is where I am from.
            echo"After 1 week of research and due to the volume of research which already exist on the numerous brands of coffee, types, strengths, value, quanity.
            I have come to a general mathematical solution which is a bit of a range in the amount of caffeine per serving. This range isn't precise and it is primarily
            aimed at coffee drinkers who typically drink cafeine from the Arab nations and the Carribean. Which is typically known as medium to strong coffee.
            At the present moment this application is at its infancy and will slowly be improved upon in clarity with precision. Hopefully my findings will improve over time!
            But at the present moment to my understanding it can be said that a medium roast 10.oz cup of coffee tends to be at 120mg of coffee after that the range will vary.
